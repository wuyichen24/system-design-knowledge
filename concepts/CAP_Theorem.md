# CAP Theorem

## Concepts
- Any distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees:
   - **Consistency**: All nodes can see the same data at the same time.
   - **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
   - **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to work despite message loss or partial failure.

## Combinations
| Combination | Database | Error Handling |
|----|----|----|
| CP (Consistency over Availability) | Relational Database | The system will return an error or a time out if particular information cannot be guaranteed to be up to date. |
| AP (Availability over Consistency) | NoSQL Database | The system will always try to return the most recent available version of the information, but the information cannot be guaranteed to be up to date. |
| CA  | | |
