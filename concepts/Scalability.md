## Concepts
- System can handle more load or increase performance by adding more resources.

## Types
- **Vertical scaling (Scale up)**
   - Add more resources (CPU, memory, etc.) into a single node.
- **Horizontal scaling (Scale out)**
   - Add more nodes into a system.

## Limitations for vertical scaling
- Vertical scaling has a hard limit (It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server).
- Vertical scaling doesn't have failover and redundancy.
