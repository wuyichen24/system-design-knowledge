# API Performance

## How to improve API performance
- **Optimize database queries**
   - Add indexes to tables.
   - Process denormalization.
- **Caching**
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Reduce payload size**
   - Enable compression (e.g., gzip or Brotli)
   - Use efficient serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers (protobuf).
   - Using pagination, filtering.
- **Load balancing and horizontal scaling**
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming API requests across multiple server instances.
   - Add more API server instances to handle increased traffic. Implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust server instances based on demand.
