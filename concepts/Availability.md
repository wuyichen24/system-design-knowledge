# Availability

## How to achieve high availability
- *Redundancy*
   - Implement redundancy at various levels, including hardware, software, and data.
   - Redundancy will eliminate single points of failure.
   - Geographical redundancy: Deploy systems in multiple data centers or regions.
   - Human and process redundancy: Cross-train staff to perform critical roles and tasks to avoid service disruptions due to the unavailability of specific individuals.
- *Failover mechanisms*
   - Set up automatic failover mechanisms that detect when a primary component fails and redirect traffic to a backup or standby.
- *Load balancing*
   - Deploy load balancers to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple servers or instances.
   - Load balancers can redirect traffic away from failed servers and improve resource utilization.
- *Service isolation*
   - Isolate critical services or components to prevent a failure in one area from affecting the entire system.
- *Monitoring and alerting*
   - Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies, performance issues, and failures in real time.
- *Regular backups*
   - Create regular backups of critical data, configurations, and system images.
- *Regular maintenance*
   - Conduct regular maintenance activities, including software updates, patches, and hardware inspections.
- *Disaster recovery planning*
   - Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that outlines procedures for handling different types of disasters or disruptions.
   - Test disaster recovery plans periodically to ensure they are effective.

## Metrics
- *Uptime and downtime*
   - The total uptime and downtime over a specific time period.
- *Availability percentage*
   - The percentage of time that a system is fully operational.
   - Percentages of a particular order of magnitude are sometimes referred to by the number of nines or "class of nines" in the digits.
- *Downtime frequency*
   - Track the frequency of downtime incidents over a specific time period.
- *Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)*
- *Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)*
