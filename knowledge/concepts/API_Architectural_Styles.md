## Overview
- SOAP
- REST
- RPC
   - gRPC
- GraphQL
- Web socket
- Webhook

## SOAP
- **History**
   - 1998
- **Full name**
   - Simple Object Access Protocol
- **Concepts**
   - An XML-formatted, highly standardized web communication protocol.
   - SOAP is a successor of XML-RPC and also uses XML to encode its HTTP-based calls.
- **Message**
   - *Format*:
      - XML
   - *Structure*:
      - Envelope: Identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.
      - Header: Contains header information.
      - Body: Contains call and response information.
      - Fault: Provides information about errors that occurred while processing the message.
- **Dependent protocols**
   - HTTP
   - SMTP
- **Pros**
   - *Platform-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream platforms.
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
   - *Error handling*
      - SOAP provides a standardized way to handle errors and exceptions.
   - *Security*
      - SOAP meets an enterprise-grade transaction quality. It provides privacy and integrity inside the transactions while allowing for encryption on the message level.
- **Cons**
   - *Outdated*
   - *Only support XML*
   - *Message is heavyweight*
   - *Need specialized knowledge*
   - *Only support request/response style communication*
      - The client sends a request and needs to wait for a response.
      - Doesn't support streaming.
- **Use cases**
   - *Highly secured data transmission*
      - Financial industry
   - *Legacy system*

## REST
- **History**
   - 2000
- **Full name**
   - Representational State Transfer
- **Concepts**
   - An architectural style and set of constraints for designing networked applications and web services.
- **6 constraints**
   - *Clientâ€“server architecture*
      - Separate as client and server.
      - Allows either client or server to evolve independently.
   - *Statelessness*
      - The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.
      - Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
   - *Cacheability*
      - Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.
      - Clients and intermediaries can cache responses.
   - *Layered system*
      - Intermediaries can be placed between the client and server, such as load balancers, API gateways, proxy servers.
      - Those intermediaries will enhance scalability, security.
   - *Code on demand (optional)*
      - Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code
   - *Uniform interface*
      - REST encourages the use of a uniform and consistent interface for interacting with resources.
      - This simplifies client implementation and enhances the predictability of the API.
- **Message**
   - *Format*
      - Plain text
      - JSON
      - XML
      - HTML
   - *Structure*
      - URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): Identifies the resource being accessed or manipulated.
      - Method: Indicates the intended action to be performed on a resource.
         - GET
         - POST
         - PUT
         - DELETE
         - PATCH
      - Headers: Provides additional metadata about the request or response.
      - Request body: Contains data that the client sends to the server to create or update a resource.
- **Dependent protocols**
   - HTTP/1.1 (most common)
- **Pros**
   - *Most common API architectural styles*
      - Large ecosystem and community
   - *Simple*
   - *Easy to debug*
      - You can test a API from a web browser.
   - *Scalability*
      - Statelessness: The server doesn't have to retain past client request information.
      - Cacheability: Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client-server interactions.
   - *Platform-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream platforms.
      - Client and server can use different platform.
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
      - Client and server can use different programming language.
- **Cons**
   - *Difficult in practice*
      - REST is simple in theory, but difficult in practice*
      - REST has a lot of good practices which is not enforced by the protocols.
   - *Weakly typed interfaces*
      - REST is not required to have a service definition and type definition of the information shared between client and server.
   - *Text-based message*
      - Message is heavyweight.
      - Inefficient for transporting binary data.
   - *Only support request/response style communication*
      - The client sends a request and needs to wait for a response.
      - Doesn't support streaming.
   - *Single resource*
      - Fetching multiple resources is challenging*
- **Use cases**
   - Public APIs
   - Simple resource-drive APIs
   
## RPC
- **History**
- **Full name**
   - Remote Procedure Call
- **Concepts**
   - A protocol and technique for invoking functions or procedures in a remote system.
- **RPC frameworks**

  | Name | Description | Message encoding | Introduced by |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | gRPC | A RPC framework for high performance data transmition. | Protocol Buffers | Google |
  | Avro RPC | A RPC framework for high performance data transmition. | Avro | |
  | Thrift RPC | A RPC framework for high performance data transmition. | Thrift | Facebook |
  | Finagle | A RPC framework for the JVM, used to construct high-concurrency servers. | |
  | Twrip | | Protocol Buffers | Twitch |
  | Cap'n Proto | | | |

- **Pros**
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
- **Cons**
   - *Tight coupling*
      - Leads to tight coupling between the client and server, making it challenging to evolve and update the system without breaking compatibility.
   - *Hard to change*
   - *Hard to debug*

## gRPC
- **History**
   - 2016
- **Concepts**
   - A cross-platform open source high performance RPC framework created by Google.
- **Message**
   - *Format*
      - Protocol Buffers
- **Dependent protocols**
   - HTTP/2
- **Pros**
   - *Efficient and compact inter-process communication (IPC)*
      - Especially when exchanging large messages.
   - *Support bidirectional streaming*
      - Client can send request data to server while server is sending the response data back.
   - *Strongly typed interfaces*
      - gRPC uses protocol buffers as the interface definition language to define how interface looks like.
   - *Built-in features*
      - Authentication
      - Encryption
      - Resiliency (deadlines and timeouts)
      - Metadata exchange
      - Load balancing
      - Service discovery
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
      - Client and server can use different programming language.
      - Client and server only need to share the interface definition file for generating stubs respectively.
- **Cons**
   - *Not for external*
      - May not be suitable for external-facing services.
   - *Need to regenerate code*
      - When the interface definition changes hugely, we need to regenerate code for both client and server.
   - *Small ecosystem*
   - *Legacy firewall might not support HTTP/2*


## Avro RPC
- **Pros**
   - *No need to generate code beforehand*
      - Client and server exchange schemas in the connection handshake and code generation is not required.
## GraphQL
## Web socket
## Webhook
