# API Architectural Styles

## Overview
- SOAP
- REST
- RPC
   - gRPC
- GraphQL
- Web socket
- Webhook

## SOAP
- **History**
   - 1998
- **Full name**
   - Simple Object Access Protocol
- **Concepts**
   - An XML-formatted, highly standardized web communication protocol.
- **Message**
   - *Format*:
      - XML
   - *Structure*:
      - Envelope: Identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.
      - Header: Contains header information.
      - Body: Contains call and response information.
      - Fault: Provides information about errors that occurred while processing the message.
- **Dependent protocols**
   - Application layer protocols
      - HTTP
      - SMTP
- **Pros**
   - *Platform-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream platforms.
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
   - *Error handling*
      - SOAP provides a standardized way to handle errors and exceptions.
   - *Security*
      - SOAP meets an enterprise-grade transaction quality. It provides privacy and integrity inside the transactions while allowing for encryption on the message level.
- **Cons**
   - *Outdated*
   - *Only support XML*
   - *Message is heavyweight*
   - *Need specialized knowledge*
- **Use cases**
   - *Highly secured data transmission*
      - Financial industry
   - *Legacy system*

## REST
- **History**
   - 2000
- **Full name**
   - Representational State Transfer
- **Concepts**
   - An architectural style and set of constraints for designing networked applications and web services.
- **6 constraints**
   - *Clientâ€“server architecture*
      - Separate as client and server.
      - Allows either client or server to evolve independently.
   - *Statelessness*
      - The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.
      - Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
   - *Cacheability*
      - Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.
      - Clients and intermediaries can cache responses.
   - *Layered system*
      - Intermediaries can be placed between the client and server, such as load balancers, API gateways, proxy servers.
      - Those intermediaries will enhance scalability, security.
   - *Code on demand (optional)*
      - Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code
   - *Uniform interface*
      - REST encourages the use of a uniform and consistent interface for interacting with resources.
      - This simplifies client implementation and enhances the predictability of the API.
- **Message**
   - *Format*
      - Plain text
      - JSON
      - XML
      - HTML
      - Binary (file uploading)
   - *Structure*
      - URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): Identifies the resource being accessed or manipulated.
      - Method: Indicates the intended action to be performed on a resource.
         - GET
         - POST
         - PUT
         - DELETE
         - PATCH
      - Headers: Provides additional metadata about the request or response.
      - Request body: Contains data that the client sends to the server to create or update a resource.
- **Dependent protocols**
   - Application layer protocol
      - HTTP
- **Pros**
   - *Most common API architectural styles*
      - Large ecosystem and community
   - *Simple*
   - *Easy to debug*
      - You can test a API from a web browser.
   - *Scalability*
      - Statelessness: The server doesn't have to retain past client request information.
      - Cacheability: Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client-server interactions.
   - *Platform-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream platforms.
      - Client and server can use different platform.
   - *Language-independent*
      - Supported by all mainstream programming languages.
      - Client and server can use different programming language.
- **Cons**
   - *Message is heavyweight*
   - *Fetching multiple resources is challenging*
- **Use cases**
   - Public APIs
   - Aimple resource-drive APIs
   
## RPC
- **History**
- **Full name**
   - Remote Procedure Call
- **Concepts**
   - A computer program causes a procedure to execute in a another computer remotely.
- **Pros**
- **Cons**
