## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- **Asynchronous**
   - A producer doesnâ€™t wait for the message to be processed.
- **Decoupling**
   - Producers are completely unaware of consumers (Don't have to know the IPs and ports of receivers).
   - Producers or consumers can be modified and deployed independently.
- **Buffering/Rate limiting**
   - It can act as a buffer if the consumer is unavailable or overloaded.
- **Fan-out**
   - The producer simply drops the message on the queue, and the multiple consumers process the message based on their needs at their own pace.

### Cons
- **Single point of failure**
   - The message queue can be a potential single point of failure.
- **Increase complexity**
   - Increase system complexity and operational complexity.

## Selection
### Factors
- **Supported programming languages**
- **Message ordering**
   - The order of messages can be preserved by the queue or not.
- **Message retention/expiration**
   - The limited period of time the message will be retained in the queue before being discarded.
- **Delivery guarantees**
   - *At-least-once*: Every message from the source system will reach its destination, but sometimes retries will cause duplicates (delivery times >= 1).
   - *Exactly-once*: Every message from the source system will reach the destination with no possibility for loss or duplication (delivery times = 1).
   - *At-most-once*: Every message from the source system may reach the destination with no possibility for duplication (delivery times <= 1).
- **Availability**
- **Scalability**
- **Latency**

## Common problems and solutions
### How to guarantee message order
If a message queue cannot preserve the order of messages on its own, how to keep messages delivered in order (FIFO).
- **Solution 1**: Add sequencing information into each message.

### How to handle duplicated message
If there are duplicate messages in a message queue, how the receiver handles duplicate messages (Achieve exactly-once delivery guarantee from at-least-once delivery guarantee).
- **Solution 1**: Make the receiver idempotent.
   - The receiver can process the same message multiple times without no additional effect.
- **Solution 2**: Track each message which has been processed into a data store and discard duplicates.
   - Add a unique identifier into each message.
