## Motivation
- The client must keep track of multiple services.
- Each service must handle some cross-cutting tasks, like authentication, authorization, etc.

## Solution
### Concepts
![](../diagrams/png/api_gateway_small.png)
- The single entry point into the backend services from external clients.
- Offloads cross-cutting functionalities from individual services to the API gateway.

### Functions
- **Core functions**
   - **Request Routing**: Routes requests to one or more backend services, using layer 7 routing.
      - It can be based on method (GET, POST, etc.), IP, port, header, or URL.
   - **API Composition/Aggregation**: Aggregates multiple individual requests into a single request.
- **Cross-cutting functions**
   - **Monitoring, logging, analytics and billing**
      - Metrics collection: Collects metrics on API usage
      - Logging: Log requests.
   - **Security**
      - Authentication: Verifies the identity of the client making the request.
      - Authorization: Verifies that the client is authorized to perform that particular operation.
      - SSL termination: Decrypts the SSL-encrypted requests from clients and pass on unencrypted requests to the internal services.
      - Certificate management
      - IP whitelisting and IP blacklisting
   - **Protocol translation and service discovery**
      - Protocol translation: Translates external requests in one protocol to internal requests in another protocol.
   - **Rate limiting and circuit breaking**
      - Rate limiting: Limits how many requests per second from either a specific client and/or from all clients.
      - Circuit breaking: The mechanisms to detect failures and recover quickly from failures
   - **Caching**: Caches responses to reduce the number of requests made to the internal services.

### Solution Options
- Use an API gateway or API management product.
   - See [API Management Products]() for more information.
- Develop an API gateway based on an API gateway framework.

   - [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway)
   
### Implementation
- Business logic should never be offloaded from the backend services to the API gateway.
- Generates and injects correlation IDs into the requests for logging purposes and distributed tracing.

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- Encapsulates internal structure of the application.
- Centralize the cross-cutting functionalities (authentication, authorization, etc.) into one place.
- Reduces the number of requests/roundtrips by API Composition/Aggregation.

### Cons
- May introduce single point of failure.
- May introduce performance bottleneck.
- Must update the API gateway in order to expose a new servicesâ€™s API.

## Consideration
| Topic | Consideration | Possible Solution Options |
|----|-----|-----|
| Reliability | The API gateway may introduce single point of failure. | <li>Consider to run multiple instances of API gateway. |
| Performance | The API gateway may introduce performance bottleneck. | <li>Make sure the API gateway is sufficiently scalable. |
