# Database (DB)

## Types
### Relational and non-relational database
| | Relational database | Non-relational database |
|---|---|---|
| Alias | SQL database | NoSQL database |
| Schema | Fixed | Dynamic |
| Query Language | SQL | UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) |
| Scalability | Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Transaction Guarantee | ACID | BASE (for performance and scalability) |
| Sub-types | | <li>Document<li>Wide-column<li>Key-value<li>Graph<li>Object<li>Tuple |
| When to use | <li>Structured data<li>Need for complex joins<li>Need for ACID guarantee<li>The scale of data is small/medium and consistent | <li>Semi-structured or unstructured data<li>No need for complex joins<li>No need for ACID guarantee<li>The scale of data is huge (TB or PB) and grows massively (high scalability)<li>Need for high performance (high throughput, super-low latency) |

### Common types of NoSQL database
| Type | Concept | Pros | Products |
|----|----|----|----|
| Document-oriented | Documents encapsulate and encode data in some standard formats or encodings (JSON,XML,YAML,BSON). | <li>Flexibility (Schemaless)<li>High Performance | <li>MongoDB<li>CouchDB<li>Terrastore<li>OrientDB<li>RavenDB |
| Column-oriented | Store data tables by column rather than by row. | <li>Distributed<li>Highly-available<li>Optimized for write | <li>Cassandra<li>HBase<li>Hypertable<li>Amazon SimpleDB |
| Keyâ€“value | Use map as fundamental data model. | <li>Reduce latency for accessing active data. | <li>Redis<li>Memcache |
| Graph | Node is the data and edge is the relationship. | <li>Good for storing data relationship.<li>No schema change and data movement when changing relationship. | <li>Neo4J<li>Infinitegraph<li>OrientDB<li>FlockDB |
   
## Techniques
### Replication
| | Master-slave | Master-master |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | ![C9ioGtn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644854-b334b680-a931-11eb-9ff5-60f57652b09d.png) | ![krAHLGg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644889-cc3d6780-a931-11eb-956d-c6eebf2f218f.png) |
| Alias | Single-leader | Multi-leader |
| Write operations | Master only  | Masters |
| Read operations | Master and slaves | Masters |
| Failure handling | <li>If the master is down, one of the slave will be promoted to be a new master. | <li>If one master is down, other masters can still handle reads and writes. |

### Partitioning
- **Types**
   - Horizontal partitioning (Sharding): Split data by row.
   - Vertical partitioning: Split data by column.
   - Functional partitioning (Federation): Split data into multiple databases by function (table).
- **Pros**
   - Less read and write traffic to a single database/shard.
   - If one database/shard is down, other databases/shards will be still operational.
   - More writes in parallel to increase throughput.
- **Cons and solutions**
   | Cons | Solution |
   |----|----|
   | Join operation is complex. | De-normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table (See [Denormalization](#denormalization-materialized-view)) |
   | Rebalance is complex. | |
   | Introduce hot spots (celebrity problem). | Allocate a partition for each celebrity. Each partition might even require further partition. |
- **Sharding**
   - Strategies
     | | By key range | By hash of key |
     |---|---|---|
     | Example | ![ddia_0602](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647540-09a4f380-a938-11eb-9621-eeeff91e442c.png) | ![ddia_0603](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647659-525cac80-a938-11eb-847f-c44bfec9f68a.png) |
     | Concept | Assign a range of keys to each partition. | Assign a range of hashes to each partition. |
     | Pros | <ul><li>Range queries are easy.</ul> | <ul><li>Keys distributing is fair among the partitions.</ul> |
     | Cons | <ul><li>Certain access patterns can lead to hot spots (A partition with disproportionately high load).</ul> | <ul><li>Lose the ability to do efficient range queries.</ul> |
   - Directory based sharding
      - Concepts
         - Place a lookup service in front of the sharded databases.
            - The lookup service knows the current partitioning scheme.
            - The lookup service keeps a map of each entity and which database shard it is stored on.
         - When we need to query the database, query the lookup service first to figure out which shard has the data we want.
      - Pros
         - Loose coupling: Any partitioning scheme changes will encapsulated and will not impact on the application.

- **Concept**
   - Add redundant copies of data or by grouping data to improve the read performance of a database
- **Pros**
   - Improve read performance.
- **Cons**
   - Degrade write performance.
   - Increase complexity of database design.
   - Data is duplicated.
