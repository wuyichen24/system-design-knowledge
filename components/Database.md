### Details of main types
#### Relational databases
- **Key points**
   - Relational databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.
   - Relational databases is suitable for storing structured data.
- **Pros**
   - *Structured data*
      - Data in relational databases is stored in tables with a predefined schema, enforcing a consistent structure throughout the database.
   - *Relationships and referential integrity*
      - The relationships between tables in a relational database are defined by primary and foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.
   - *SQL support*
      - Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, manipulating, and managing data. SQL is a powerful and widely adopted language that enables developers to perform complex queries and data manipulations.
   - *Transactions and ACID properties*
      - Relational databases support transactions, which are sets of related operations that either succeed or fail as a whole. This feature ensures the ACID properties are maintained, guaranteeing data consistency and integrity.
   - *Indexing and optimization*
      - Relational databases offer various indexing techniques and query optimization strategies, which help improve query performance and reduce resource consumption.
- **Cons**
   - *Limited scalability*
      - Scaling relational databases horizontally (adding more nodes) can be challenging.
   - *Low flexibility*
      - The predefined schema in relational databases can make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements, as altering the schema may require significant modifications to existing data and applications.
   - *Performance issues*
      - As the volume of data grows, relational databases may experience performance issues, particularly when dealing with complex queries and large-scale data manipulations.
   - *Inefficient for unstructured or semi-structured data*
      - Relational databases may not be suitable for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data or sensor data.
- **Common products**
   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL
   - Oracle Database
   - Microsoft SQL Server
   - Amazon RDS
   - SQLite
   - IBM Bb2
   - MariaDB

      - An extension to the CAP theorem.
      - In case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed system, one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C) (as per the CAP theorem), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
- **Levels**
   - *Strong consistency*
      - All nodes in the system see the same version of data at the same time. 
      - Based on [ACID](../concepts/Transaction.md#acid-consistency-over-availability) properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability).
   - *Eventual consistency*
      - All nodes will eventually converge to the same state, but it's possible for different nodes to have different views of the data for a certain period of time.
      - Based on [BASE](../concepts/Transaction.md#base-availability-over-consistency---eventual-consistency) properties (Basically Available, Soft state and Eventually consistent).
   - *Causal Consistency*
      - All nodes see updates that are causally related in the same order.
- **Considerations**
   - Consider the performance requirements of the project.
      - Financial applications need strong consistency.
      - For other applications, eventual consistency is enough.

      - Examples: Data stored in relational databases, spreadsheets, CSV, TSV.
   - *Semi-structured*
      - Semi-structured data is less rigidly organized compared to structured data.
      - It doesn't conform to a fixed schema, but it does have some form of hierarchy or organization.
      - Examples: Data stored in NoSQL databases, JSON, XML.
   - *Unstructured*
      - Unstructured data lacks a predefined structure or format.
      - Examples: Text documents, social media posts, images, videos, audios.
- **Considerations**
   - Consider schema flexibility.
   - Consider support for complex data relationships.
- **Characteristics**
   - Relational databases use a fixed schema and support complex data relationships.
   - NoSQL databases often offer more flexible schemas and can be better suited for flexible data relationships.

      - Databases should provide robust mechanisms for managing user accounts, roles, and permissions.
   - Consider the encryption and data protection capabilities.
      - Use strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256
      - Databases could provide additional data protection features (e.g. data masking or redaction).
   - Consider to integrate databases with built-in security mechanisms (e.g. identity providers, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems).

#### Cost
- **Considerations**
   - Consider fee and cost:
      - Licensing fee.
      - Hosting fee.
      - Maintenance and management cost.
         - Software and hardware upgrades.
         - Staff training.

## Techniques
### Replication
| | Master-slave | Master-master |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | ![C9ioGtn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644854-b334b680-a931-11eb-9ff5-60f57652b09d.png) | ![krAHLGg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644889-cc3d6780-a931-11eb-956d-c6eebf2f218f.png) |
| Alias | Single-leader | Multi-leader |
| Write operations | Master only  | Masters |
| Read operations | Master and slaves | Masters |
| Failure handling | <li>If the master is down, one of the slave will be promoted to be a new master. | <li>If one master is down, other masters can still handle reads and writes. |

### Partitioning
- **Types**
   - Horizontal partitioning (Sharding): Split data by row.
   - Vertical partitioning: Split data by column.
   - Functional partitioning (Federation): Split data into multiple databases by function (table).
- **Pros**
   - Less read and write traffic to a single database/shard.
   - If one database/shard is down, other databases/shards will be still operational.
   - More writes in parallel to increase throughput.
- **Cons and solutions**
   | Cons | Solution |
   |----|----|
   | Join operation is complex. | De-normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table (See [Denormalization](#denormalization-materialized-view)) |
   | Rebalance is complex. | |
   | Introduce hot spots (celebrity problem). | Allocate a partition for each celebrity. Each partition might even require further partition. |
- **Sharding**
   - Strategies
     | | By key range | By hash of key |
     |---|---|---|
     | Example | ![ddia_0602](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647540-09a4f380-a938-11eb-9621-eeeff91e442c.png) | ![ddia_0603](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647659-525cac80-a938-11eb-847f-c44bfec9f68a.png) |
     | Concept | Assign a range of keys to each partition. | Assign a range of hashes to each partition. |
     | Pros | <ul><li>Range queries are easy.</ul> | <ul><li>Keys distributing is fair among the partitions.</ul> |
     | Cons | <ul><li>Certain access patterns can lead to hot spots (A partition with disproportionately high load).</ul> | <ul><li>Lose the ability to do efficient range queries.</ul> |
   - Directory based sharding
      - Concepts
         - Place a lookup service in front of the sharded databases.
            - The lookup service knows the current partitioning scheme.
            - The lookup service keeps a map of each entity and which database shard it is stored on.
         - When we need to query the database, query the lookup service first to figure out which shard has the data we want.
      - Pros
         - Loose coupling: Any partitioning scheme changes will encapsulated and will not impact on the application.
