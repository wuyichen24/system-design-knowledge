### Details of main types
#### Relational databases
- **Key points**
   - Relational databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.
   - Relational databases is suitable for storing structured data.
- **Pros**
   - *Structured data*
      - Data in relational databases is stored in tables with a predefined schema, enforcing a consistent structure throughout the database.
   - *Relationships and referential integrity*
      - The relationships between tables in a relational database are defined by primary and foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.
   - *SQL support*
      - Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, manipulating, and managing data. SQL is a powerful and widely adopted language that enables developers to perform complex queries and data manipulations.
   - *Transactions and ACID properties*
      - Relational databases support transactions, which are sets of related operations that either succeed or fail as a whole. This feature ensures the ACID properties are maintained, guaranteeing data consistency and integrity.
   - *Indexing and optimization*
      - Relational databases offer various indexing techniques and query optimization strategies, which help improve query performance and reduce resource consumption.
- **Cons**
   - *Limited scalability*
      - Scaling relational databases horizontally (adding more nodes) can be challenging.
   - *Low flexibility*
      - The predefined schema in relational databases can make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements, as altering the schema may require significant modifications to existing data and applications.
   - *Performance issues*
      - As the volume of data grows, relational databases may experience performance issues, particularly when dealing with complex queries and large-scale data manipulations.
   - *Inefficient for unstructured or semi-structured data*
      - Relational databases may not be suitable for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data or sensor data.
- **Common products**
   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL
   - Oracle Database
   - Microsoft SQL Server
   - Amazon RDS
   - SQLite
   - IBM Bb2
   - MariaDB

## Techniques
### Replication
| | Master-slave | Master-master |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | ![C9ioGtn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644854-b334b680-a931-11eb-9ff5-60f57652b09d.png) | ![krAHLGg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116644889-cc3d6780-a931-11eb-956d-c6eebf2f218f.png) |
| Alias | Single-leader | Multi-leader |
| Write operations | Master only  | Masters |
| Read operations | Master and slaves | Masters |
| Failure handling | <li>If the master is down, one of the slave will be promoted to be a new master. | <li>If one master is down, other masters can still handle reads and writes. |

### Partitioning
- **Types**
   - Horizontal partitioning (Sharding): Split data by row.
   - Vertical partitioning: Split data by column.
   - Functional partitioning (Federation): Split data into multiple databases by function (table).
- **Pros**
   - Less read and write traffic to a single database/shard.
   - If one database/shard is down, other databases/shards will be still operational.
   - More writes in parallel to increase throughput.
- **Cons and solutions**
   | Cons | Solution |
   |----|----|
   | Join operation is complex. | De-normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table (See [Denormalization](#denormalization-materialized-view)) |
   | Rebalance is complex. | |
   | Introduce hot spots (celebrity problem). | Allocate a partition for each celebrity. Each partition might even require further partition. |
- **Sharding**
   - Strategies
     | | By key range | By hash of key |
     |---|---|---|
     | Example | ![ddia_0602](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647540-09a4f380-a938-11eb-9621-eeeff91e442c.png) | ![ddia_0603](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/116647659-525cac80-a938-11eb-847f-c44bfec9f68a.png) |
     | Concept | Assign a range of keys to each partition. | Assign a range of hashes to each partition. |
     | Pros | <ul><li>Range queries are easy.</ul> | <ul><li>Keys distributing is fair among the partitions.</ul> |
     | Cons | <ul><li>Certain access patterns can lead to hot spots (A partition with disproportionately high load).</ul> | <ul><li>Lose the ability to do efficient range queries.</ul> |
   - Directory based sharding
      - Concepts
         - Place a lookup service in front of the sharded databases.
            - The lookup service knows the current partitioning scheme.
            - The lookup service keeps a map of each entity and which database shard it is stored on.
         - When we need to query the database, query the lookup service first to figure out which shard has the data we want.
      - Pros
         - Loose coupling: Any partitioning scheme changes will encapsulated and will not impact on the application.

- **Concept**
   - Add redundant copies of data or by grouping data to improve the read performance of a database
- **Pros**
   - Improve read performance.
- **Cons**
   - Degrade write performance.
   - Increase complexity of database design.
